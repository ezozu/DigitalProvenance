# Digital Provenance: Secure and Transparent Data Tracking

This repository provides a Python-based framework for establishing and maintaining digital provenance for various types of data, ensuring its integrity and traceability throughout its lifecycle.

## Detailed Description

Digital Provenance is a critical aspect of data management, especially in fields like scientific research, digital asset management, and supply chain tracking. This project addresses the need for a robust and auditable system to record the history of data modifications, transformations, and ownership. The core objective of this framework is to provide a transparent and secure mechanism for tracking data origins and alterations. By meticulously recording each step in the data's journey, Digital Provenance offers verifiable evidence of its integrity and authenticity. This is achieved through a combination of cryptographic techniques, immutable logging, and a flexible architecture that can be adapted to various data formats and workflows.

The primary feature of Digital Provenance is its ability to create a cryptographically secure chain of custody for digital assets. Every modification or transformation applied to a data object is recorded as a distinct event within the provenance chain. These events are linked together using cryptographic hashes, creating an unalterable record of the data's history. This chain of events provides a comprehensive audit trail, allowing users to trace the data back to its original source and verify each step along the way. This level of traceability is crucial for ensuring data quality, detecting unauthorized modifications, and complying with regulatory requirements.

Beyond basic tracking, the Digital Provenance framework is designed for extensibility. It allows developers to define custom data models and provenance event types, tailoring the system to specific application needs. The framework also supports integration with various data storage solutions, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, and cloud-based storage services. This flexibility makes Digital Provenance a versatile solution for managing data provenance in a wide range of environments. Furthermore, the framework offers tools for querying and analyzing the provenance data, allowing users to gain insights into data lineage, identify potential data quality issues, and optimize data workflows.

## Key Features

*   **Cryptographic Hashing:** Employs SHA-256 hashing algorithm to create unique fingerprints for each data object and provenance event, ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering.
*   **Immutable Provenance Chain:** Stores provenance information in a linked chain structure, where each event is cryptographically linked to the previous one, making it virtually impossible to alter the historical record. This chain is constructed using a Merkle Tree-like approach for enhanced security.
*   **Customizable Data Models:** Allows users to define their own data models and event types using Python classes, enabling the framework to be adapted to various data formats and application domains. The model schema is enforced using Pydantic for data validation.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Uses a publish-subscribe pattern for registering and processing provenance events, allowing for asynchronous processing and scalability. This is implemented using the `asyncio` library for concurrent event handling.
*   **Flexible Storage Backend:** Supports multiple storage backends for storing provenance data, including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and cloud-based object storage. The storage backend is configurable through environment variables.
*   **Queryable Provenance Logs:** Provides an API for querying the provenance logs based on various criteria, such as data object ID, event type, and timestamp. Queries are optimized using database indexes.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implements RBAC to control access to provenance data and restrict who can create or modify provenance events. Access control is enforced using decorator functions.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python 3.9+:** The primary programming language used for developing the framework.
*   **Pydantic:** Used for data validation and defining data models, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
*   **SQLAlchemy (or equivalent database library):** Used for interacting with relational databases, providing an ORM layer for data persistence. Alternatives like Motor for MongoDB are supported.
*   **asyncio:** Used for asynchronous event processing, enabling the framework to handle a large number of events concurrently.
*   **PyJWT (JSON Web Token):** Used for implementing authentication and authorization, securing access to the provenance data.
*   **pytest:** Used for writing and running unit tests and integration tests, ensuring the quality and reliability of the framework.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/ezozu/DigitalProvenance.git`

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    `cd DigitalProvenance`

3.  Create a virtual environment:

    `python3 -m venv venv`

4.  Activate the virtual environment:

    `source venv/bin/activate` (on Linux/macOS)

    `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows)

5.  Install the dependencies:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Configuration

The following environment variables need to be configured:

*   `DATABASE_URL`: The URL of the database to use for storing provenance data (e.g., `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`).
*   `STORAGE_TYPE`: Specifies the storage backend to use (e.g., `postgresql`, `mongodb`, `s3`).
*   `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: A secret key used for signing JWT tokens for authentication and authorization. Generate a strong, random key.
*   `S3_BUCKET_NAME` (Optional): The name of the S3 bucket to use for storing data (if `STORAGE_TYPE` is set to `s3`).
*   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (Optional): The AWS access key ID (if `STORAGE_TYPE` is set to `s3`).
*   `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (Optional): The AWS secret access key (if `STORAGE_TYPE` is set to `s3`).

These environment variables can be set using `.env` files or by exporting them directly in the shell.
